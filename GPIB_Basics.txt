What is GPIB stands for?
	General Purpose Interface Bus - it was produced first by hp in 1965 and SCPI (Standard
	Command for Programmable Instruments) took the command structures defined in IEEE 488.2
	and created a single comprehensive programming command set that is used wih any SCPI.

What does GPIB do?
	GPIB devices communicate with other GPIB devices by sending device-dependant messages and interface
	messages trough the interface system.

Type of GPIB messages:
	1.Device dependant messages
		Often called "data" and contain device-specific information, such as programming instructions,
		measurement results, machine status and data files.
	2.Interface messages
		these msges manage the bus. Usually called "commands", interfac emessages perform such functions
		as initializing the bus, addressing and unaddressing devices, and setting modes for remote or local 
		programming.

GPIB can have 3 roles:
	1. Controller:
		The Controller monitors communications network(other GPIBs). When the controller notices that a device wants to send a data, it connects the Talker to the appropriate 
		Listener. You can think of the controller role as a CPU in computer or a switching center of a city telephone system.
		Mutiple controllers can be configured. but at any time only one CIC (Contorller in Charge) can exist. 

	2. Talker:
		Talker sends data messages to one or more Listeners, which receive the data.
	3. Listener:
		Listeners receives data from Talkers.

NOTE: A computer with appropriate hardware/software can perfurm the roles of Talker/Listener/Controller.
NOTE: Some GPIB configurations do not require a Controller. For example, a device that is always a Talker, called a talk-only device, is connected to one or more listen-only devices.
